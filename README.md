# Destructuring

**Instructions**
#### 1. Array Destructuring
* Declare the variables `fruit`, `vegetable`, `food`. Assign the following values to the variables respectively: "banana", "cucumber", "bread", "cakes", "pizza" (assign the "bread", "cakes" and "pizza" to `food`). Use array destructuring to complete this task.

#### 2.Object Destructuring
* Create an object which contains a few key value pairs of human names and halloween costumes e.g. `fran: "witch"`. Assign each value to a variable. Print out the values.

#### 3. Parameters: Object Destructuring 
* Create an object with band/musician details e.g. name of the band/musician, greatest hit, nationality, genre etc. 
* Then, create a function to print all of the band/musician's data. 
* Example
```javascript
`Regina Spektor is a American-Russian singer/songwriter and pianist. The musician sings indie-pop and their greatest hit is "Us"`.
```
